# DS-MARKET 

This project is the final result of my journey to become Data Scientist. Here, we present a deliverable solution for managing the products of their stores of a company according to its requets.

Requirements:
- To analize the state of each store, the sales trends of the products, and their evolution,possibly by Country.
- Identify similar groups of products; how many exist?
- Forecast of sales.
- Forecast inventory supply.

## Sprint 1

1. We received 3 datasets with information of company(__item_prices__, __item_sales__, __daily_calendar_with_events__)
2. Check and clean the datasets, understand the variables and analyze the data.(Worked with **python** using libraries like **numpy**,**pandas**,**matplolib**,**seaborn**)
3. Preprocessing to build the main dataset; here we created a dataset to show the visualization report and other dataset for clustering.

## Sprint 2

1. Worked in clustering. Used **K-means**.
2. Choosed the correct model for prediction, **Arima** vs **skforecast** of **Sklearn**.

## Sprint 3

1. Worked in visualization report.
2. Make prediction with model choose.
3. Worked in storytelling about results.
